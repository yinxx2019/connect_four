Q. Did you attempt to make your computer player very smart -- i.e., 
do something more clever than just pick a random legal move?
A. Yes. Originally I just used random to select a random position but the game tured to be super boring so I learned minimax algorithm online and implemented it in this assignment.
    
Q.If so, were you able to accomplish this? Is your computer player as smart as you would like?
A. Yes. The minimax algorithm helps my AI to find the best position to set the disk and it is even smarter than me.

Q.How did you determine which piece to play next? Tell us about your “pick next move” algorithm
A.The major principle of my AI is to find places that can form 4 in a row to win. It also monitors if the human player has 3 in a row, horizontally, vertically, diagonally and will block the player. In addition, the AI will look 4 steps ahead to evaluate the player's best move, and then my AI chooses its own best move to maximize the winning chance.

Q. How often did your computer program beat you, or your friends, or whoever tested it out for you?
How would you improve it in the future?
A. Almost 100% times. I only won once after more than 10 tests. Once I learn more about the minimax algorithm, I will see how to make the AI less smart to help players enjoy the game.
